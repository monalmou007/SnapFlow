Being a part of the Windows operating system, cmdkey.exe is generally considered safe and does not pose any risk of being a virus or malware; however, users should always verify the file's location, as malicious software can sometimes masquerade as legitimate system files. Errors related to cmdkey.exe may occur if the file is corrupted or if there are issues with user permissions, potentially leading to problems with accessing network resources that require stored credentials.
